judgment, and equity;\r\n\r\n4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.\r\n\r\n5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:\r\n\r\n6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.\r\n\r\n7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.\r\n\r\n8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:\r\n\r\n9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.\r\n\r\n10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.\r\n\r\n11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:\r\n\r\n12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:\r\n\r\n13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:\r\n\r\n14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:\r\n\r\n15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:\r\n\r\n16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.\r\n\r\n17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\r\n\r\n18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.\r\n\r\n19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.\r\n\r\n20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:\r\n\r\n21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,\r\n\r\n22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?\r\n\r\n23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.\r\n\r\n24 Because I have called, and ye refused;

A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.\r\n\r\n2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.\r\n\r\n3 The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.\r\n\r\n4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.\r\n\r\n5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.\r\n\r\n6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.\r\n\r\n8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.\r\n\r\n9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.\r\n\r\n10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.\r\n\r\n11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.\r\n\r\n13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.\r\n\r\n14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.\r\n\r\n15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.\r\n\r\n16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.\r\n\r\n17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.\r\n\r\n18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.\r\n\r\n19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.\r\n\r\n20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.\r\n\r\n21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.\r\n\r\n22 The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.\r\n\r\n23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.\r\n\r\n24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.\r\n\r\n25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.\r\n\r\n26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.\r\n\r\n27 The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.\r\n\r\n28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.\r\n\r\n29 The way of the Lord is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.\r\n\r\n30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.\r\n\r\n31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.\r\n\r\n32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.","1 A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight.\r\n\r\n2 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.\r\n\r\n3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.\r\n\r\n4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.\r\n\r\n5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.\r\n\r\n6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.\r\n\r\n7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.\r\n\r\n8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.\r\n\r\n9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.\r\n\r\n10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.\r\n\r\n11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.\r\n\r\n13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.\r\n\r\n14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.\r\n\r\n15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.\r\n\r\n16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.\r\n\r\n17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.\r\n\r\n18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.\r\n\r\n19 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.\r\n\r\n20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.\r\n\r\n21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\r\n\r\n22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.\r\n\r\n23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.\r\n\r\n24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\r\n\r\n25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.\r\n\r\n26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.\r\n\r\n27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.\r\n\r\n28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.\r\n\r\n29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.\r\n\r\n30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.\r\n\r\n31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.","1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.\r\n\r\n2 A good man obtaineth favour of the Lord: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.\r\n\r\n3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.\r\n\r\n4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.\r\n\r\n5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.\r\n\r\n6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.\r\n\r\n7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.\r\n\r\n8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.\r\n\r\n9 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.\r\n\r\n10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.\r\n\r\n11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.\r\n\r\n12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.\r\n\r\n13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.\r\n\r\n14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.\r\n\r\n15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.\r\n\r\n16 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.\r\n\r\n17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.\r\n\r\n18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.\r\n\r\n19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.\r\n\r\n20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.\r\n\r\n21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.\r\n\r\n22 Lying lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight.\r\n\r\n23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.\r\n\r\n24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.\r\n\r\n25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.\r\n\r\n26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.\r\n\r\n27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.\r\n\r\n28 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.","1 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.\r\n\r\n2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.\r\n\r\n3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.\r\n\r\n4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.\r\n\r\n5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.\r\n\r\n6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.\r\n\r\n7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.\r\n\r\n8 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.\r\n\r\n9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.\r\n\r\n10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.\r\n\r\n11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.\r\n\r\n12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.\r\n\r\n13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.\r\n\r\n14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.\r\n\r\n15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.\r\n\r\n16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.\r\n\r\n17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.\r\n\r\n18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.\r\n\r\n19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.\r\n\r\n20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.\r\n\r\n22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.\r\n\r\n23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.\r\n\r\n24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.\r\n\r\n25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.","1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.\r\n\r\n2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.\r\n\r\n3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.\r\n\r\n4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.\r\n\r\n5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.\r\n\r\n6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.\r\n\r\n7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.\r\n\r\n8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.\r\n\r\n9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.\r\n\r\n10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.\r\n\r\n11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.\r\n\r\n12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\r\n\r\n13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.\r\n\r\n14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.\r\n\r\n15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.\r\n\r\n16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.\r\n\r\n17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.\r\n\r\n18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.\r\n\r\n19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.\r\n\r\n20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.\r\n\r\n21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.\r\n\r\n22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.\r\n\r\n23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.\r\n\r\n24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.\r\n\r\n25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.\r\n\r\n26 In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.\r\n\r\n27 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.\r\n\r\n28 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.\r\n\r\n29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\r\n\r\n30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.\r\n\r\n31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.\r\n\r\n32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.\r\n\r\n33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.\r\n\r\n34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.\r\n\r\n35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.","1 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.\r\n\r\n2 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.\r\n\r\n3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.\r\n\r\n4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.\r\n\r\n5 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.\r\n\r\n6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.\r\n\r\n7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.\r\n\r\n8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.\r\n\r\n9 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.\r\n\r\n10 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.\r\n\r\n11 Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?\r\n\r\n12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.\r\n\r\n13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.\r\n\r\n14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.\r\n\r\n15 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.\r\n\r\n16 Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith.\r\n\r\n17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.\r\n\r\n18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.\r\n\r\n19 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.\r\n\r\n20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.\r\n\r\n21 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.\r\n\r\n22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.\r\n\r\n23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!\r\n\r\n24 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.\r\n\r\n25 The Lord will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.\r\n\r\n26 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.\r\n\r\n27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.\r\n\r\n28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.\r\n\r\n29 The Lord is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.\r\n\r\n30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.\r\n\r\n31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.\r\n\r\n32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.\r\n\r\n33 The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.","1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord.\r\n\r\n2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.\r\n\r\n3 Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.\r\n\r\n4 The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.\r\n\r\n5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.\r\n\r\n6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.\r\n\r\n7 When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.\r\n\r\n8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.\r\n\r\n9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps.\r\n\r\n10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.\r\n\r\n11 A just weight and balance are the Lord's: all the weights of the bag are his work.\r\n\r\n12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.\r\n\r\n13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.\r\n\r\n14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.\r\n\r\n15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.\r\n\r\n16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!\r\n\r\n17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.\r\n\r\n18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.\r\n\r\n19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.\r\n\r\n20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.\r\n\r\n21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.\r\n\r\n22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.\r\n\r\n23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.\r\n\r\n24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.\r\n\r\n25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\r\n\r\n26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.\r\n\r\n27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.\r\n\r\n28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.\r\n\r\n29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.\r\n\r\n30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.\r\n\r\n31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.\r\n\r\n32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.\r\n\r\n33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.","1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.\r\n\r\n2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.\r\n\r\n3 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord trieth the hearts.\r\n\r\n4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.\r\n\r\n5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.\r\n\r\n6 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.\r\n\r\n7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.\r\n\r\n8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.\r\n\r\n9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.\r\n\r\n10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.\r\n\r\n11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.\r\n\r\n12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.\r\n\r\n13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.\r\n\r\n14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.\r\n\r\n15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.\r\n\r\n16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?\r\n\r\n17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\r\n\r\n18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.\r\n\r\n19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.\r\n\r\n20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.\r\n\r\n21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.\r\n\r\n22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.\r\n\r\n23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.\r\n\r\n24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.\r\n\r\n26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.\r\n\r\n27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.\r\n\r\n28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.","1 Through desire

then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.\r\n\r\n4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.\r\n\r\n5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.\r\n\r\n6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.\r\n\r\n7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.\r\n\r\n8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.\r\n\r\n10 The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.\r\n\r\n11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.\r\n\r\n12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.\r\n\r\n13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.\r\n\r\n14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?\r\n\r\n15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\r\n\r\n16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.\r\n\r\n17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.\r\n\r\n18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.\r\n\r\n19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.\r\n\r\n20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.\r\n\r\n21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.\r\n\r\n22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.\r\n\r\n23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.\r\n\r\n24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.","1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.\r\n\r\n2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.\r\n\r\n3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the Lord.\r\n\r\n4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.\r\n\r\n5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.\r\n\r\n6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.\r\n\r\n7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.\r\n\r\n8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.\r\n\r\n9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.\r\n\r\n10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.\r\n\r\n11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.\r\n\r\n12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.\r\n\r\n13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.\r\n\r\n14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the Lord.\r\n\r\n15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.\r\n\r\n16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.\r\n\r\n17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.\r\n\r\n18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.\r\n\r\n19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.\r\n\r\n20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.\r\n\r\n21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.\r\n\r\n22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.\r\n\r\n23 The fear of the Lord tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.\r\n\r\n24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.\r\n\r\n25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.\r\n\r\n26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.\r\n\r\n27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.\r\n\r\n28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.\r\n\r\n29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.","1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;\r\n\r\n2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;\r\n\r\n3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;\r\n\r\n4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;\r\n\r\n5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.\r\n\r\n6 For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.\r\n\r\n7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.\r\n\r\n8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.\r\n\r\n9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.\r\n\r\n10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;\r\n\r\n11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:\r\n\r\n12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;\r\n\r\n13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;\r\n\r\n14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;\r\n\r\n15 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:\r\n\r\n16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;\r\n\r\n17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.\r\n\r\n18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.\r\n\r\n19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.\r\n\r\n20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.\r\n\r\n21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.\r\n\r\n22 But the wicked shall be cut off from

reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.\r\n\r\n5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.\r\n\r\n6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?\r\n\r\n7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.\r\n\r\n8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.\r\n\r\n9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?\r\n\r\n10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.\r\n\r\n11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.\r\n\r\n12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both

way, then he boasteth.\r\n\r\n15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.\r\n\r\n16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.\r\n\r\n17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.\r\n\r\n18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice

the Lord, and he shall save thee.\r\n\r\n23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the Lord; and a false balance is not good.\r\n\r\n24 Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way?\r\n\r\n25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.\r\n\r\n26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.\r\n\r\n27 The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.\r\n\r\n29 The glory of young

sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?\r\n\r\n28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.\r\n\r\n29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.\r\n\r\n30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord.\r\n\r\n31 The horse is prepared against the day of

the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.\r\n\r\n20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.\r\n\r\n21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:\r\n\r\n22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;\r\n\r\n23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.\r\n\r\n24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:\r\n\r\n25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;\r\n\r\n26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;\r\n\r\n27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;\r\n\r\n28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.\r\n\r\n29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:\r\n\r\n30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;\r\n\r\n31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.\r\n\r\n32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.\r\n\r\n33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.","1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.\r\n\r\n2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?\r\n\r\n3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.\r\n\r\n4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:\r\n\r\n5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.\r\n\r\n6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.\r\n\r\n7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.\r\n\r\n8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.\r\n\r\n9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.\r\n\r\n10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.\r\n\r\n11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.\r\n\r\n12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\r\n\r\n13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.\r\n\r\n14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.\r\n\r\n15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.\r\n\r\n16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.\r\n\r\n17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.\r\n\r\n18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.\r\n\r\n19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.\r\n\r\n20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.\r\n\r\n21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.\r\n\r\n22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.\r\n\r\n23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.\r\n\r\n24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.\r\n\r\n25 Strength and honour are her clothing;

her husband also, and he praiseth her.\r\n\r\n29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.\r\n\r\n30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.\r\n\r\n31 Give her of the fruit of her hands;

and his reproach shall not be wiped away.\r\n\r\n34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.\r\n\r\n35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.","1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.\r\n\r\n2 Keep my commandments, and live;

my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,\r\n\r\n2 For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.\r\n\r\n3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,\r\n\r\n4 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.\r\n\r\n5 Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.\r\n\r\n6 In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.\r\n\r\n7 Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.\r\n\r\n8 Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.\r\n\r\n9 Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;\r\n\r\n10 And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine thy presses break forth.\r\n\r\n11 Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,\r\n\r\n12 For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.\r\n\r\n13 O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a man [who] bringeth forth understanding.\r\n\r\n14 For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold -- her increase.\r\n\r\n15 Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.\r\n\r\n16 Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are] wealth and honour.\r\n\r\n17 Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace.\r\n\r\n18 A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her [is] happy.\r\n\r\n19 Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.\r\n\r\n20 By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.\r\n\r\n21 My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,\r\n\r\n22 And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.\r\n\r\n23 Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.\r\n\r\n24 If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.\r\n\r\n25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.\r\n\r\n26 For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.\r\n\r\n27 Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is] toward God to do [it].\r\n\r\n28 Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.\r\n\r\n29 Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.\r\n\r\n30 Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.\r\n\r\n31 Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.\r\n\r\n32 For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with the upright [is] His secret counsel.\r\n\r\n33 The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.\r\n\r\n34 If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.\r\n\r\n35 Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!","4 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.\r\n\r\n2 For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.\r\n\r\n3 For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only one before my mother.\r\n\r\n4 And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.\r\n\r\n5 Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.\r\n\r\n6 Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.\r\n\r\n7 The first thing [is] wisdom -- get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.\r\n\r\n8 Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.\r\n\r\n9 She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.\r\n\r\n10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life [are] multiplied to thee.\r\n\r\n11 In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.\r\n\r\n12 In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.\r\n\r\n13 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she [is] thy life.\r\n\r\n14 Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.\r\n\r\n15 Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.\r\n\r\n16 For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to stumble.\r\n\r\n17 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.\r\n\r\n18 And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,\r\n\r\n19 The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.\r\n\r\n20 My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,\r\n\r\n21 Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.\r\n\r\n22 For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.\r\n\r\n23 Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the outgoings of life.\r\n\r\n24 Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,\r\n\r\n25 Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.\r\n\r\n26 Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are] established.\r\n\r\n27 Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!"]}],S=[{name:"Regular",value:"regular"},{name:"Medium",value:"medium"},{name:"Large",value:"large"}],I=[{name:"Default",value:""},{name:"Night Mode",value:"night-mode"},{name:"Blue-Gray",value:"blue-gray"},{name:"Pretty Pink",value:"pretty"},{name:"Professional",value:"professional"},{name:"Lamborghini",value:"lamborghini"},{name:"Teh Tarik",value:"tea"}],L={preferredTranslation:"YLT",textSize:"regular",colorMode:"blue-gray"},E={preferredTranslation:"KJV",textSize:"regular",colorMode:""};o.a.render(h.a.createElement(k,{pages:T,settings:L,defaultSettings:E,translations:A,sizes:S,colorModes:I,title:"Proverbs Everyday",todaysDate:m()().format("DD MMM YYYY"),day:Number(m()().format("D"))}),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))},9:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(16)}},[[9,1,2]]]);
